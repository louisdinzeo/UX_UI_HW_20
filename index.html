        <h1>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>IDEATION is about helping people keep good habits and creating new ones. The primary idea is that the next time someone would go on vacation, they would use this app beforehand and see how many steps they would take, they could try finding more food native to the area, and they could find more cultural events and be more involved with what's going on locally.</p>

    <div class="USER RESEARCH">
        <h2>Phase 1: User Research</h2>
            <p>Ideation's user research phase was the first bit of UX work I ever did. I created an interview plan and interviewed five different people. I recorded those interviews and created a user persona based on those interviews. I took all of this data from the interviews and made sticky notes with user insights on them. I sorted those by person, then I sorted them into an affinity diagram. From there, I made an empathy map. I learned with these steps that people would travel even further than expected in some case if the destination was a place they desired or if the process of traveling was part of an experience. What came of all this information and analysis was a user persona. She was a photographer that wanted to maximize her time being outside and wanted to continue to improve her daily step count.</p>

    <div class="DEFINITION & SYNTHESIS">
        <h2>Phase 2: Definition & Synthesis</h2>
            <p>This was the hardest part (well besides my ambitious wireframe idea, which I'll get to). I struggled for a long time with what the official problem I was solving should be, until I finally knew my direction. I wanted this app to be a form of self-care. I wanted to help people become their best selves. And I know exactly where my best self is; on vacation. I'm the happiest, the most energized, and travel by foot so much. It all clicked. After completing the Value Proposition Canvas, the Feature Prioritization Matrix, and the User Scenario, I felt confident in where this project was going.</p>

    <div class="IDEATION + LO-MID PROTOTYPING">
        <h2>Phase 3: Ideation + Lo-mid Prototyping</h2>
        <p>The ideation was when everything that had clicked before formed into more questions. What would I name this app? What would the app look like? With all of this in mind, I crafted the user flow, did the competitive analysis, and made two versions of the wireframes: the sketches and the lo-fi. I didn't love either really... at all. I wanted it to be more me. It felt basic, bland, and nothing to make someone feel more alive.</p>
        <p><img src=""></p>
    </div>
    <div class="HI-FI PROTOTYPE">
        <h2>Phase 4: Hi-Fi prototype</h2>
        <p>The ideation and the prototyping (minus the hi-fi digital wireframes) was all kind of one phase for this project. The hi-fi also felt like one large phase because of my ideas. I lined up every corner of every text box and made that text fit perfectly into each frame, which took an extreme amount of time. I also made the logo completely myself using PixilArt which was something I'm so proud of. This was it; the app looked exactly how I wanted it to. It was engaging, had humor, was colorful, it had depth... it was everything I imagine and I didn't even get past the onboarding portion of the project. All of my hard work paid off and that was easily the best login/register flow of wireframes I've ever made.</p>
        <p><img src=""></p>
    </div>
    <div class="USER TESTING + OUTCOMES">
        <h2>Phase 5: User Testing + Outcomes</h2>
        <p>The user testing was interesting because I totally came to the conclusion that there was quite a bit that could use editing with my wireframes. The text was hard to read and the flow still had an issue or two. They all thought it was good though and thought it "ran smoothly". The biggest issue overall was that I forgot to put a back feature into the wireframes, which caused frustration with the user. I fixed that immediately, along with amost everything else that they said could be better. The outcome was a phenominal app idea that I would still present today. There was nothing I was ashamed of and am happy I chose the direction I did.</p>
        <p><img src=""></p>
    </div>
    <div class="CONCLUSION + FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES">
        <h2>Phase 6: Conclusion + Future Opportunities</h2>
        <p>This was my first project and definitely one of my favorites. I am super proud of how hard I worked on this and how it came out. These wireframes are my personal favorites out of all of my projects. They are fun, out-of-the-box, and yet have so much room for improvement. Also, the interview questions I wrote are definitely the best interview questions that I have ever come up with. They were clever and engaging; giving me a wide variation of input from the users that ended up being essential to figuring out/solidifying the purposes of this app.
            
            I have not iterated anything since the testing phase of this project. The biggest improvement to be made is to make an accessibility feature that allows users to edit the siteâ€™s overall look to best suit their wants/needs.</p>
